          This blog post is about my hometown, San Francisco, California!
          I'm from the Sunset District, which is just south of Golden Gate Park. 
          It's also where my high school, Abraham Lincoln HS, is. Here's a fun 
          fact: it was the school that was used for a popular cartoon called 
          The Amazing World of Gumball.

          SF is a beautiful city that I think everybody should visit at least once in
          their life. We have good food, many tourist destinations, and even a great
          public transportation system called the Muni! I, like many others, didn't even
          start driving until near the end of high school because I always took the bus
          everywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you visit, make sure to bring some warm clothes because it's almost
          always foggy and windy here. I, personally, enjoy SLO's perfect weather more
          than I ever did SF's. To add to that, there's a local saying that "there are
          no seasons in San Francisco" because the weather is the same year-round.
          Through the summer, it remains cold. In the winter, it doesn't snow. (Actually,
          there have only been a handful of times when snow was recorded, the last time
          being 1976).

          Unfortunately, San Francisco lies in the San Andreas Fault and has had severe
          earthquakes in the past. The next one is predicted to have a magnitude of 6.7
          or larger within the next 30 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the danger, it's still a city that I'll always be proud to be from.
          If you don't love it already, I hope that someday you will get to visit and
          see why people say it's so great!
